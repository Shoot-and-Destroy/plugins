-- Each team picks the enemy's intel up near its own spawn and pushes
-- it to its own tent, which stands out near the enemy's spawn: every capture is a run
-- through the enemy, and a carrier who falls leaves the intel where it lies.
-- The rules are capture the flag's (rules = "ctf"); the script only moves
-- the intels and the tents.
